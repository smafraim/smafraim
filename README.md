I'm currently an outgoing student in Computer Science and working on Data Analysis and Machine learning. I'm looking to collaborate on projects/challenges with outsiders on the same interest as me. Moreover, I'm learning about Computer vision and Neural networks as well. Fun fact is I never knew that I'd be this much of a geek.
